  üõ°Ô∏è Mythic & Kali Linux RDP Brute Force Attack Simulation
This project simulates a real-world Red Team engagement using Kali Linux, Hydra, and the Mythic C2 framework to gain and maintain access to a Windows Server hosted on Vultr. It demonstrates offensive security techniques including brute-force attacks, payload deployment, and command-and-control (C2) operations.

üñ•Ô∏è Lab Environment
  * Attacker Machine: Kali Linux

  * Target Machine: Windows Server on Vultr

  * C2 Platform: Mythic

  * Tools Used:

  * Mythic C2

  * Hydra (for RDP brute force)

  * Windows PowerShell

  * MITRE ATT&CK framework

  * RDP & Windows command line utilities

üîß Phase 1: Server Setup
Deployed a Windows Server using Vultr cloud hosting

Enabled RDP access and configured basic firewall rules

‚öôÔ∏è Phase 2: Mythic Installation
Installed Mythic on the server using PowerShell and Git

![Mythic Installed](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/raw/main/images/image5.png)

Set up the Mythic GUI and verified connectivity

üõ†Ô∏è Phase 3: Pre-Attack Configuration
  * Created a fake sensitive file on the Windows Server: passwords.txt

Prepared the environment for brute-force attack simulation

üö® Phase 4: RDP Brute Force Attack
Used Hydra on Kali Linux with a default wordlist to brute-force RDP credentials

![List of default passwords](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/raw/main/images/image10.png)

Successfully gained access to the Windows Server via RDP

![Hydra](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/raw/main/images/image11.png)

Executed initial commands:

whoami

ipconfig

net user, net group

Disabled Windows Defender to ensure payload execution

üí£ Phase 5: Payload Deployment & C2 Connection
Created and configured a Mythic agent and C2 profile

![Agent & C2](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/raw/main/images/image16.png)

Generated a custom payload in Mythic

![Payload](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/raw/main/images/image17.png)

Transferred the payload to the target server over RDP

Got a successful callback from the agent to the Mythic GUI

![Payload](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/raw/main/images/image19.png)

Ran remote commands on the victim machine from the Mythic interface

Retrieved the fake sensitive file as proof of access
