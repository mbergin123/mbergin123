### üß≠ Analyzing Network Traffic to Create a Baseline Definition

**Course/Lab:** Jones & Bartlett Learning ‚Äî *Analyzing Network Traffic to Create a Baseline Definition*
**Author:** Marilyn Bergin

### üìå Overview

This project demonstrates capturing, transferring, and analyzing network traffic to establish a **network baseline**. The lab simulates a real-world enterprise environment with servers, routers, switches, and vulnerable applications. Using tools such as **TCPdump, Wireshark, FileZilla, Tftpd64, and NetWitness Investigator**, I captured normal and malicious traffic, analyzed protocol distributions, and verified file transfers across the environment.

### Why It‚Äôs Important
Understanding how to capture and analyze network traffic is essential for maintaining secure and reliable systems. Establishing a network baseline allows security professionals to distinguish between normal and abnormal activity, which is critical for detecting threats such as malware infections, data exfiltration, or unauthorized access. By analyzing traffic with tools like TCPdump, Wireshark, and NetWitness, I developed the ability to identify vulnerabilities, monitor real-time communication patterns, and validate the integrity of network operations. This skill is foundational in cybersecurity, as it transforms raw network data into actionable insights for prevention, detection, and incident response.

This documentation highlights an end-to-end demonstration of real-world skills in:

* Packet capture and command-line analysis
* Using Wireshark for deep inspection
* File transfers with FTP/TFTP and validation
* Detecting vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS in DVWA)
* Using NetWitness Investigator for forensic investigation

This project highlights my ability to not only use security tools, but also to interpret results, validate findings, and document them in a professional manner.

### üéØ Learning Objectives

* Capture live traffic with TCPdump and Wireshark
* Identify baseline network protocols and normal traffic flows
* Generate traffic with FTP, TFTP, SSH, and Telnet
* Detect insecure applications (DVWA XSS reflected attack)
* Transfer and verify files with FileZilla and Tftpd64
* Use NetWitness Investigator for forensic packet analysis

### üó∫Ô∏è Topology

Lab environment included:

* **Servers/Hosts:** DVWA (Debian Linux), vWorkstation (Windows Server 2016), Target Windows 2016
* **Network Devices:** Cisco Routers (Norfolk 2811, Tampa 2811), Cisco Switches (LAN Switch1 & Switch2)
* **Applications/Tools:** TCPdump, Wireshark, PuTTY, FileZilla, Tftpd64, NetWitness Investigator


### üß∞ Tools & Software

* **Capture/Analysis:** TCPdump, Wireshark, NetWitness Investigator
* **File Transfer:** FileZilla (FTP), Tftpd64 (TFTP)
* **Access/Connectivity:** PuTTY (SSH/Telnet)
* **Target Application:** Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA)

### üîπ Section 1 ‚Äî Capturing and Analyzing Network Traffic

#### Step 1: Launch PuTTY on DVWA server & confirm TCPdump

Connected to **172.30.0.13** and confirmed `tcpdump` availability using `man tcpdump`.

![First_Putty](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/blob/main/images/FirstPutty.png)
![Result_of_PuTTy](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/blob/main/images/ResutlsOfFirstPutty.png)

#### Step 2: Identify Interfaces

Inspected `/etc/network/interfaces` to confirm **eth0** (static 172.30.0.13) was the capture interface.

![Results_of_Cat_Interface](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/blob/main/images/ResultsOfCatInter.png)

#### Step 3: Start Capture

Ran `tcpdump -i eth0 -n -w tcpdumpcapturefile` to capture packets directly to file.

![Tcpdump_capture_start](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/blob/main/images/tcpdumpCapStart.png)

#### Step 4: Generate HTTP Traffic via DVWA

Accessed DVWA homepage and modules to create baseline HTTP traffic.

* Opened homepage
* Set DVWA security level to *low*
* Tested XSS reflected input with name *Simon*
* Confirmed XSS vulnerability with `<script>alert('this is a vulnerability');</script>`

  ![XXS_Vulnerability](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/blob/main/images/ThisIsVul.png)

#### Step 5: Validate Capture Results

Stopped capture and verified with `tcpdump -n -r tcpdumpcapturefile`. Observed HTTP GET/200 OK requests between **172.30.0.2** and **172.30.0.13**.

![Results_of_tcpdump_Capture](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/blob/main/images/ResultsOfCap.png)

#### Step 6: Locate XSS Payload in Capture

Filtered capture with grep to locate encoded `<script>` payload within HTTP stream.

### üîπ Section 2 ‚Äî Wireshark Analysis

#### Step 7: Launch Wireshark on Remote Server (172.30.0.10)

Captured live traffic (TCP, UDP, Telnet, SSH, ARP).

![WireShark_Start](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/blob/main/images/WSstart.png)

#### Step 8: Switch & Router Checks

Ran `show interface` and `show vlan` on **LanSwitch1 (172.16.8.5)**, **LanSwitch2 (172.16.20.5)**, and **Tampa 2811 (172.17.8.1)** to verify interface status and VLAN mapping.

![Show_Vlan](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/blob/main/images/showvlan.png)

#### Step 9: Additional SSH Checks

Ran `show interface` on **172.16.8.1**, confirming FastEthernet0/0 up and configured.

#### Step 10: SSH into DVWA Server

Logged in as `student` to **172.30.0.13** and confirmed session access.

![DVWASSH](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/blob/main/images/DVWAputtySHH.png)

#### Step 11: Protocol Hierarchy

Analyzed protocol distribution: 84% UDP, 15% TCP; breakdown included Telnet, SSH, FTP, TFTP.

![Protocol_H](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/blob/main/images/ProtoclH.png)

#### Step 12: Packet Length Statistics

Observed most packets in **40‚Äì79 bytes (48%)** and **320‚Äì639 bytes (42%)** range.

### üîπ Section 3 ‚Äî File Transfers (FTP & TFTP)

#### Step 13: FileZilla Transfers

* Opened FileZilla dashboard
* Uploaded `AnyConnect_adminguide.pdf` to **172.30.0.10**
* Verified file present on remote desktop

  ![File_Loaded_on_Server](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/blob/main/images/loadedonServer.png)

#### Step 14: Tftpd64 Transfers

* Launched Tftpd64 dashboard
* PUT `AnyConnect_adminguide.pdf` from **172.30.0.2 ‚Üí 172.30.0.10** (9428 blocks transferred)
* Verified file present on **172.30.0.2** via directory listing

### üîπ Section 4 ‚Äî NetWitness Investigator

#### Step 15: Launch NetWitness Investigator

Opened dashboard on **172.30.0.10**.

![NetWitness_Investigator_Dashboard](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/blob/main/images/NetWisDash.png)

#### Step 16: Import Wireshark Capture

Uploaded saved `.pcap` file into Investigator, creating a collection view of services and IPs.

![NetWitness_Packet_Viewing](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/blob/main/images/NetWisPacket.png)

#### Step 17: Deep Dive on FTP Evidence

Located FTP details revealing:

* Filename: `anyconnect_adminguide.pdf`
* Password used: `p@ssw0rd!`
  
  ![Filename_and_Password](https://github.com/mbergin123/mbergin123/blob/main/images/Filename%26Pass.png)

### ‚úÖ Key Results & Takeaways

* **Baseline traffic**: Normal patterns included HTTP web browsing, ARP broadcasts, Telnet/SSH sessions, and file transfers.
* **Vulnerability identified**: DVWA‚Äôs reflected XSS allowed arbitrary script execution; confirmed in both browser and captured traffic.
* **File transfer validation**: Demonstrated FTP and TFTP transfers, confirmed by presence on remote servers.
* **Forensic investigation**: NetWitness highlighted service use, user accounts, filenames, and clear-text credentials.

### üöÄ Why This Matters for Employers

This project shows I can move beyond running tools ‚Äî I:

* Captured and validated real network traffic
* Reproduced vulnerable traffic for testing
* Used **multiple analysis tools** to corroborate findings
* Documented results in a professional, reproducible way

I combined hands-on tool usage with an awareness of their strategic value in network defense and incident response
